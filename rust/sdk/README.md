# M10 SDK

The M10 (SDK) gives you access to the M10 APIs allowing you to build custom clients and banking integrations with the M10 Platform. Whether you are a central bank implementing custom applications, or a new Fintech who wants to build atop an M10 CBDC, the SDK is your first stop. 

The M10-SDK is documented primary using Rustdoc, and that is the best way to get more info.
